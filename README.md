# Restaurant-Management-System
This Project aims to provide services and hospitality by digitally in the hotel area. There are already a couple of hotel management site and application for ordering and booking services in Hotel. But Smart Restaurant would be a first in its kind and a unique application to mainly focus on the guest and staff of hotel. For a developing country like ours where the literacy rate is below the average, this project might help the hotel owner, manager and supervision to get/server their better service to their Customers onto a platform that really is built for one and only them.
There is a great necessity of such systems that would collaborate to reduce the management risk and promote the hotel. This project aims to provide a platform where people can view, search and order at a very effective and easy manner without any hard processes and tedious payment gateways. So, it must be a great concern to build such a product like this project.
